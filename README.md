# Pagination-And-Filtering
This student directory program is done completely in vanilla JS and has three main functions.
* showPage dynamically divides student data into 3x3 grids, displaying nine student profiles per page.
* addPagination dynamically creates and inserts clickable, numbered page buttons to navigate the pages.
* addSearchBar creates and inserts a search bar which allows for case-insensitive search filtering of student names. If no matches are found, "No Results Found" is displayed on the page.
